# Networkers Data View Feature Specification

## Overview

The Networkers Data View feature is responsible for displaying a list of networkers with search and filtering capabilities. It follows a mobile-first design approach and provides an intuitive interface for browsing and finding networkers.

## Core Responsibility

- Render a list of `Networker[]` objects (type from `@networker.ts`)
- Display each networker as a compact card showing key information
- Provide search and filtering functionality
- Ensure responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Data Structure

Based on the `Networker` type:

```typescript
type Networker = {
	id: NetworkerId;
	name: string;
	jobTitle: string[];
	company: CompanyId[];
	location: LocactionId[];
	email: string[];
	phoneNumber: string[];
	socialProfiles: string[];
	tags: TagId[];
	whereYouMet: string;
	generalNotes: string;
	personalTraits: string;
	interactionHistory: InteractionHistoryId[];
	lastUpdatedDate: ISODateString;
};
```

## Components Architecture

### 1. NetworkerList (Main Container)

**Purpose**: Main container component that orchestrates the entire networkers view

**Props**:

```typescript
type NetworkerDataView = Pick<Networker, 'id' | 'name' | 'jobTitle'> & {
	lastLocation: Location;
	lastCompany: Company;
	tags: Tag[];
};

type Props = {
	networkers: NetworkerDataView[];
};
```

**Responsibilities**:

- Manage search and filter state
- Coordinate between search, filter, and list components
- Handle data fetching and state management
- Provide responsive layout container

**Features**:

- Responsive grid layout (1 column on mobile, 2-3 columns on tablet/desktop)
- Loading states
- Empty state handling
- Error state handling

### 2. NetworkerListItem (Individual Card)

**Purpose**: Render individual networker information in a compact card format

**Props**:

```typescript
type Props = {
	networker: NetworkerDataView;
	onClick?: (networker: Networker) => void;
};
```

**Display Information**:

- **Name**: Primary identifier, prominently displayed
- **Location**: Resolved location name from `LocactionId` (take last location from list as most relevant)
- **Company**: Resolved company name from `CompanyId` (take last company from list as most relevant)
- **Job Title**: Last job title from the array (if available)

**Design Requirements**:

- Card-based layout with subtle shadows
- Hover effects for interactivity
- Compact information display
- Touch-friendly on mobile devices
- Consistent spacing and typography

### 3. NetworkerSearch (Search Functionality)

**Purpose**: Provide text-based search across networker data

**Props**:

```typescript
interface NetworkerSearchProps {
	onSearch: (query: string) => void;
	placeholder?: string;
	debounceMs?: number;
}
```

**Features**:

- Real-time search with debouncing
- Search across: name, job titles, company names, location names
- Clear search functionality
- Search history (optional)
- Mobile-optimized input field

**Search Logic**:

- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial string matching
- Highlight matching text in results

### 4. NetworkerFilter (Filtering System)

**Purpose**: Provide filtering options, starting with company-based filtering

Specification will be provided later.

**Features**:

- Multi-select filtering
- Clear all filters option
- Filter count indicators
- Collapsible filter panel on mobile
- Responsive filter UI

## Mobile-First Design Requirements

### Breakpoints

- **Mobile**: 320px - 768px (default)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px
- **Desktop**: 1024px+

### Mobile-Specific Considerations

- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for interactive elements
- **Card Layout**: Single column layout on mobile
- **Search Bar**: Full-width, prominent placement
- **Filters**: Collapsible panel or bottom sheet
- **Navigation**: Swipe gestures for card interactions
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens for better UX

### Responsive Behavior

- **Cards**: 1 column (mobile) → 2 columns (tablet) → 3+ columns (desktop)
- **Search**: Full-width (mobile) → Contained width (desktop)
- **Filters**: Bottom sheet/modal (mobile) → Sidebar (desktop)

## Data Flow

### Component Hierarchy

```
NetworkerList
├── NetworkerSearch
├── NetworkerFilter
└── NetworkerListItem[] (rendered in grid/list)
```

## Performance Considerations

- Virtual scrolling for large lists (future enhancement)
- Debounced search to prevent excessive API calls
- Memoized filtering logic
- Lazy loading of networker details
- Optimized re-renders using Svelte reactivity

## Accessibility Requirements

- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- ARIA labels and roles
- Color contrast compliance
- Touch target sizing

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced filtering (tags, date ranges, interaction history)
- Sorting options (name, company, location, last updated)
- Bulk actions
- Export functionality
- Advanced search operators
- Saved searches
- Networker comparison view

## Implementation Notes

- Use Svelte stores for state management
- Implement proper TypeScript types throughout
- Follow existing project patterns and conventions
- Include comprehensive unit tests
- Add Storybook stories for component development
- Ensure proper error boundaries and fallbacks
